# UdemyDL
A downloader for udemy that automatically organizes videos by chapters in folders.

I used the API provided by https://www.udeler.com/

Written in python 2.x

## Usage
From the command line:
```bash
python main.py
```

Then log in and select the course you want to download via the number associated with it.
Now it will start directly to download.

## Why use it?
It's convenient, it directly organizes the files in the folders. One could also write an interface.
